linked_list:
    In remove_first, the 'previous' pointer should be updated as well
    but I could not get it to work.
    It's not that important in this case, since previous is never used in
    the cycledetection but it is definitely not ideal, that some of the code 
    is not working.

    I chose not to store any data in the first ('root') node, which
    I don't really have a reason for, that was just my first intuition,
    when I started. It would probably be better to use it, since 
    the program is 'wasting' space for a node, however, not that much.

Generel:
    I am not freeing the allocated memory after I am done using it,
    which is not good.
