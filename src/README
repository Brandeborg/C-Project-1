linked_list:
    I chose not to store any data in the first ('root') node, which
    I don't really have a reason for, it was just my first intuition,
    when I started. It would probably be better to use it, since 
    the program is 'wasting' space for a node, however, not that much.
    
read_graph:
    Graph is initially being created without in_neighbours, and the in_neighbours are added 
    afterwards. It may have been faster to add in and out at the same time,
    but it wasn't as simple.   

    getline() is supposed to return the number of characters read in a line,
    reutrn -1 if it reads nothing, however, whenever it reads a line it always returns 1. 
    It has no effect on the program, since it still returns -1 at the end of a file and
    the number of characters in a line can be reached by other menas but it is strange. 

Generel:
    The program is not freeing all the allocated memory after it is done using it,
    only some of it, which is not good. Specifically, it frees the memory allocated
    for a list node, when the node is removed. At least it is supposed to, and running the program 
    with valgrind shows that less memory is allocated in the end, when trying to free it.
    
    The gradle test program results in my program passing on all graphs on my own system, 
    so the program seems to work, however, I am not entirely happy with the implementation. 
    Instead of passing void pointers to add_element and other methods, numbers are being passed and casted,
    which isn't very elegant.

    Everything compiles with no warnings, which is good.
