linked_list:
    I chose not to store any data in the first ('root') node, which
    I don't really have a reason for, it was just my first intuition,
    when I started. It would probably be better to use it, since 
    the program is 'wasting' space for a node, however, not that much.

Generel:
    I am not freeing all the allocated memory after I am done using it,
    only some of it, which is not good.
